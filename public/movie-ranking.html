<h1>The Best Movies According to JP</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>
    This is a great movie if you are gamer/comic/anime ethusiast.
</p>


<h3>Kick Ass</h3>
<p>
    Great comedy superhero movie, a little more on the edgy side for certain viewers.

<h3>Dragonball Super: Broly</h3>
<p>
    This is one of my all time favorite dragonball movies, from the animation to
    the plot. (RIP Akira Toriyama)
